This is the README for an example usage of Iago. This brings up an echo server on your localhost,
then creates an Iago job to send traffic to your server.

NOTE: If you are unfamiliar with sbt, check out project/build/Project.scala
NOTE2: If you are unfamiliar with how to use Iago, check out src & config/echo.scala. Also read the Iago README.


SBT COMMANDS
sbt update:                   will pull in all of your dependencies
sbt compile*:                  compiles.
sbt clean-dist:               cleans out any previous distributions
sbt package-dist*:             packages and creates a distribution at dist/

*prepend NO_VALIDATE=1 and NO_TESTS=1 to stop the tests from running
(there's a currently known bug in our dependencies that causes the tests to fail)
